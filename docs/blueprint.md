# **App Name**: DeutschWelle AI

## Core Features:

- Level-Based Curriculum: Structured German language learning from A0 to C2 levels, outlining specific grammar and vocabulary topics for each level.
- Thematic Vocabulary Modules: Vocabulary organized by theme (e.g., family, work, travel), allowing users to build practical word knowledge.
- Integrated Skills Training: Exercises covering reading, listening, writing, and speaking to provide a holistic learning experience. Some reading and listening skills are complemented by AI tools.
- Spaced Repetition System (SRS): Implementation of an SRS algorithm to schedule reviews of previously learned material at optimal intervals, maximizing retention. The intervals between repetitions will be chosen as appropriate based on the users' response times to recalling each particular detail. AI assists as a tool, assessing users' understanding to personalize and optimize repetition schedules.
- Adaptive Learning Engine: A system that dynamically adjusts the difficulty of exercises based on the user's performance, targeting their weaknesses and reinforcing their strengths. Generative AI can generate new exercises on demand that respond to specific failures the user has experienced.
- Error Analysis & Feedback: Detailed explanations for incorrect answers, including grammatical rules, example sentences, and error analysis to deepen understanding.
- Proficiency Assessment: Ensure subject matter mastery is present. Exercises are continuously generated for any subject until proficiency is shown by the user.
